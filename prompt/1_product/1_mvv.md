# Mission/Vision/Values

## Mission
**"Transform spreadsheets into playgrounds"**

Turn data manipulation from routine work into creative experimentation, making spreadsheets a medium for play and discovery within safe boundaries.

## Vision
**"Redesign the relationship between people and numbers"**

A world where working with data sparks creativity and joy, not just efficiency. Where spreadsheets become canvases for expression, experimentation becomes natural, and every data interaction feels like landing a perfect trick.

## Values

### Safety by Design
Powerful tools should be safe by default. Every feature is built within protective boundaries, ensuring you can experiment freely without system risk.

### Playful Productivity
Data exploration should be engaging, experimental, and fun while remaining genuinely useful.

### Creative Expression  
Everyone has a unique way of thinking about data. Our tools amplify personal creativity within predictable boundaries.

### Hackable Within Limits
The best tools bend to your will while keeping you safe. Everything is customizable and extensible within our protected environment.

### Excel Superset Philosophy
Innovation builds upon what people already know. We enhance Excel compatibility rather than replace it.

### Local-First Control
Your data belongs on your machine. We build desktop-first experiences that work offline and keep you in complete control.
